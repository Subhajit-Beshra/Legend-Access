# 🎂 BirthdayPayload

A fun **fake hacking console** built as a birthday surprise for my best friend — a fellow coder 💻🎉  
This project simulates a hacker-style terminal with typing animation, blinking cursor, and background music.

> ⚠️ This is NOT real hacking. Just a harmless, creative web project.
